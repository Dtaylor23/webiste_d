    <p>Welcome to my website. I was born in Vallejo 2/5/03 at 2:40am. I didn't live in Vallejo really. So im really from Richmond and Vacaville. I grew up in those places. I am trying to keep my 3.6 GPA for the remaining three years of highschool. My dream colleges are Duke, UCLA, or University of Kentucky to play basketball. Im interested in sports because Im a competitive person. For example Lebron James made basketball more interesting for me to watch and play.  He's my favorite basketball player because he doesn't care what people say about him. Some sports that I am good at are basketball, football, and baseball. I really didn't have a favorite football player until Odell Beckham Jr. Some video games I like to play are 2k, Madden, GTA, and Fortnite. What I like about school is that I know everyone there and the teachers like me. I have a lot of friends. I was also on varsity for my first year in highschool. At school I like my Health & Wellness class because we play a variety of sports and learn new ways how to stay un shape. The first year of highschool was so easy I made the honor roll all 4 quarters.

Analog & Binary 
</h2>
<p><a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/java5/Notes/chap02/ch02_1.html">Analog and Binary Signals</a></p>

<p>What I learned was that a digital watch is called that because it shows the numbers not the hands. Binary is two states meaning that it's easy to build and simple not complex. It's easier to do a setting type on a book to create it faster.

</h2>
<p><a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/java5/Notes/chap02/ch02_8.html">Binary & Analog Signals</a></p>

<p>The T2 is only on when it's over the threshold. It's off when the T1 is under the threshold. T1 and T2 is for different things while it means on/off. When something interrupted the lighting the lights get dimmer.</p>

">Slides on programming</a></p>

<p>Today we talked about program data in terminal. Coding is writing any instructions in any language. A person that code is writing from one language to another.  Code is process of writing the instructions. Programming means to program the machine with no errors.  Programming is a common word for the process of feeding the machine. Programming is solving problems. They create things and solve things. A programmer works actively on solutions. Programmer figures out the small problems.</p>

<h2>Beginning our Website
</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/
">beginning your website</a></p>

<p>Talked about servers, sublime, xamp, basic html structure, and commenting. The sublime had us make our own website by using w3schools and sublime text. The w3schools help you do html and type all the things you want on your webpage. Learned commenting is about how others can use your code and know what they are doing.</p>

Today in CS we learned what is a file system and how to use them to create a tree structure. A file is a collection of information that is important to you to keep, recorded on secondary storage. For other’s perspective a file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage.

<p>Today in CS we learned html, js, and css. These are important to programmers because they each do something different and can help us. Html do the coding, while css makes it look good and js does the animations. These things are important to know because  it is what all programmers use.</p>
